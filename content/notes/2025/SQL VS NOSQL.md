## ⚡ Why SQL is considered **Vertically Scalable**

- **Relational model** (SQL) depends on **ACID transactions, joins, and strict schema**.
    
- This means data is often **tightly coupled** → hard to split across many machines.
    
- Historically, RDBMS were **single-node systems** → easiest way to handle more load was **scale-up (vertical scaling)**.
    
- Example: Add more CPU/RAM to your MySQL/Postgres server.

## ⚡ Why NoSQL is considered **Horizontally Scalable**

- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) were built **with distributed architecture in mind**.
    
- They **sacrifice some ACID guarantees** (often use BASE model: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) to make partitioning/sharding easier.
    
- Data is stored in **key-value, document, or column family models** which are naturally easier to **distribute across nodes**.
    
- So you can add more machines (scale-out) and the DB balances data automatically.

## ⚡ But… Both Can Scale Both Ways

- **SQL can be horizontally scaled too** → through **sharding, partitioning, or distributed SQL engines** (Vitess for MySQL, Citus for Postgres, CockroachDB, Spanner).
    
- **NoSQL can be vertically scaled too** → put MongoDB or Cassandra on a bigger server (faster CPU, more RAM).

## ✅ Correct Interview-Friendly Answer

> _“Traditionally, SQL databases are vertically scalable because their relational model makes horizontal distribution harder. NoSQL databases were designed for horizontal scaling from the start, trading off strict consistency for distribution. But in practice, both SQL and NoSQL can scale vertically and horizontally — it’s just that their default design philosophies are different.”_

## **Sharding vs Partitioning**

### 🔹 **Partitioning**

- Splitting a **single database** into smaller, more manageable parts.
    
- Usually done within **one server or cluster**.
    
- Goal: **performance optimization** (e.g., smaller indexes, faster queries).
    
- Partitioning is often **logical** (the database engine still “knows” all partitions are part of the same database).
    

**Types of Partitioning**

1. **Horizontal Partitioning** – rows are split across partitions (e.g., users with IDs 1–1000 in Partition A, 1001–2000 in Partition B).
    
2. **Vertical Partitioning** – columns are split across tables/partitions (e.g., user profile info in one partition, user preferences in another).
    

👉 Example: Splitting a customer table by region (Asia partition, Europe partition).

### 🔹 **Sharding**

- A **form of horizontal partitioning** but specifically across **multiple servers/nodes**.
    
- Each shard is a **self-contained independent database**.
    
- Goal: **scalability + distribution** (handle very large datasets and high traffic).
    
- Requires a **shard key** to decide where data lives.
    
- Application or middleware is responsible for routing queries to the right shard.
    

👉 Example: MongoDB sharding customers by `user_id % 10` across 10 different machines.

## ✅ Key Differences

|Feature|Partitioning|Sharding|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Splitting data into smaller parts|Splitting data across multiple servers|
|**Scope**|Within a single DB instance|Across multiple DB instances|
|**Goal**|Performance, manageability|Scalability, distribution|
|**Data Location**|All partitions usually on same machine|Shards live on different machines|
|**Management**|DB engine manages partitions internally|Requires shard key + routing logic|

> _“Partitioning is splitting data inside one database for performance, while sharding is splitting data across multiple machines for scalability. Sharding is basically distributed horizontal partitioning.”_

👉 Sanjay, do you want me to also include a **real-world example (like how Netflix or Instagram uses sharding)** to make your answer stand out in interviews?

##### You said:

why do we need to partitioning with single db server

###### ChatGPT said:

Nice follow-up 🔥 — this shows you’re thinking beyond just definitions.

## ✅ Why Partitioning with a Single DB Server?

Even if you don’t have multiple servers (so no sharding), **partitioning inside one database server** still brings big benefits:

---

### 🔹 1. **Performance Improvement**

- Queries only scan the relevant partition instead of the whole big table.  
    👉 Example: If you partition an `orders` table by year, a query for `orders_2025` doesn’t need to scan all years.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Index Efficiency**

- Indexes are smaller within each partition.
    
- Faster lookups because the DB searches in a smaller dataset.
    

---

### 🔹 3. **Manageability**

- Large tables are easier to maintain when split into partitions.
    
- You can archive, drop, or back up old partitions (like `orders_2020`) without touching newer data.
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Parallelism**

- Some databases (Postgres, Oracle) can process queries across partitions in parallel.
    
- This reduces query time significantly.
    

---

### 🔹 5. **Availability / Fault Isolation**

- If one partition is corrupted or locked, others can still be accessed.
    
- Example: If `orders_2019` partition is being repaired, queries on `orders_2025` still run normally.

## ⚡ Real-World Example

- **Banking system**: A bank stores **transactions** for many years.
    
    - Partition transactions by **month or year**.
        
    - Querying `transactions_2025` is much faster than searching the entire history.
        
    - Old partitions can be archived to cheaper storage.


## Disadvantage of sharding

1. operationally complex , (if one shar goes down , then you want to move the data the other shard)
2. cross-shard query (which is very very expensive)
