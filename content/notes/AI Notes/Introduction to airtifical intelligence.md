**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks that normally require **human intelligence** â€” such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience.

### **1. Core Idea**

Instead of explicitly programming every rule, AI systems are designed to **learn patterns** and **adapt** based on data and experience.

### **2. Common Abilities of AI**

- **Perception** â†’ recognizing images, sounds, faces, handwriting.
    
- **Reasoning** â†’ solving problems, making logical decisions.
    
- **Learning** â†’ improving performance through data (machine learning).
    
- **Language understanding** â†’ speech-to-text, chatbots, translation.
    
- **Action** â†’ controlling robots, autonomous driving.

### **3. Types of AI (by capability)**

1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
    
    - Specialized for one task.
        
    - Examples: Siri, Google Translate, spam filters.
        
2. **General AI (Strong AI)**
    
    - Can perform any intellectual task a human can.
        
    - Doesnâ€™t exist yet â€” still theoretical.
        
3. **Superintelligent AI**
    
    - Beyond human intelligence in all aspects.
        
    - Speculative and debated.

### **4. Technologies behind AI**

- **Machine Learning (ML)** â†’ teaches computers to learn from data.
    
- **Deep Learning** â†’ uses neural networks with many layers.
    
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â†’ enables understanding and generating human language.
    
- **Computer Vision** â†’ interprets and analyzes visual data.
    
- **Reinforcement Learning** â†’ learns by trial and error to maximize rewards.

ðŸ’¡ **Simple analogy:**  
If **traditional programming** is like giving a robot step-by-step cooking instructions, **AI** is like teaching the robot by showing it thousands of cooking videos so it learns to cook on its own.
