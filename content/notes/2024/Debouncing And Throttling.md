Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, which can cause performance issues. In essence, it limits the execution of a function until a certain amount of idle time has passed without it being triggered again.

throttling is a programming concept where it triggers a function for the particular time limit
