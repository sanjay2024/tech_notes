# Crawling

When a website deployed on Heroku appears in a Google search, several things are happening behind the scenes, and these processes involve concepts like search engine optimization (SEO), web crawling, indexing, and DNS resolution. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### 1. **Search Engines and Crawling**

- **Crawling**: Search engines like Google use software called **web crawlers** (or spiders, like Googlebot) to discover and fetch web pages on the internet. These crawlers start with a list of known URLs and follow links on those pages to find new ones.
- If your website is public and accessible, Google's crawler can find it, either by direct submission (e.g., in Google Search Console) or by following links from other websites.
- **Heroku Deployment**: If your website is deployed on Heroku, it's publicly available at a URL like `your-app-name.herokuapp.com` or a custom domain (e.g., `www.yourwebsite.com`). Googlebot can crawl and index this URL if it's accessible.

### 2. **Indexing**

- **Indexing**: Once Googlebot crawls your website, it analyzes the content, structure, and metadata of your pages. It stores this information in Google's index, a huge database that holds details about all the web pages Google has crawled.
- **SEO Optimization**: To improve the chances of your site ranking higher in search results, you need to follow best practices in **SEO**. This includes adding relevant keywords, using descriptive titles and meta descriptions, optimizing images, and making the site mobile-friendly.

### 3. **Search Ranking**

- After indexing, Google's algorithms evaluate the relevance of your content to specific search queries. The page rank is influenced by many factors, including:
    - **Keywords**: How relevant the content is to the user's search query.
    - **Page Authority**: How authoritative and trustworthy your website is.
    - **User Experience**: Factors like mobile usability, page speed, and content structure.
    - **Backlinks**: Links to your site from other reputable websites.

### 4. **DNS and Domain Resolution**

- **www**: When a user types `www.yourwebsite.com`, `www` is actually a **subdomain** of your main domain (`yourwebsite.com`). The Domain Name System (DNS) translates this human-readable domain into an IP address that browsers can connect to.
- **DNS Resolution**: When someone enters `www.yourwebsite.com`, their browser queries the DNS system, which returns the IP address of the server (e.g., Heroku’s server) where your website is hosted.
- If you use a custom domain with Heroku, you'd set up DNS records (typically a CNAME or A record) to point `www.yourwebsite.com` to your Heroku app's URL.

### 5. **Behind the Scenes: Heroku and Web Requests**

- When someone clicks a link to your website from a Google search result, their browser sends an HTTP request to Heroku's servers.
- Heroku receives this request, and based on the routes and backend logic you've set up, it processes the request and returns the appropriate webpage.

### 6. **SSL and HTTPS**

- If you’ve set up SSL/TLS (which Heroku supports), your website will be served over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between the user's browser and Heroku’s servers.

### Summary:

- **Googlebot crawls** the web and discovers your website on Heroku.
- It **indexes** your content based on relevance and SEO.
- When users search for relevant terms, Google shows your website based on its **search ranking**.
- **DNS resolution** happens when users type `www.yourwebsite.com` (translating the domain to Heroku’s server IP).
- **Heroku handles the request** and delivers the webpage to the user's browser.

The key to improving visibility in Google search is effective SEO and ensuring your website is structured and optimized for both users and search engines.
