### 1. **Understand the Problem Fully (Don‚Äôt Jump to Code)**

Ask:

- What is the exact requirement?
- What is the user trying to do?
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- Are there any edge cases?

üõ†Ô∏è *Tool:* Write it down in your own words or draw a flowchart.

---

### 2. **Break It Down Into Smaller Parts**

- Divide the problem into steps or sub-tasks.
- Each small piece should be independently solvable.

---

### 3. **Think About the Logic on Paper (or a Whiteboard)**

- Sketch the main logic without worrying about syntax.
- Try writing a rough pseudo-code.
- Consider alternate paths early ‚Äî not after coding starts.

---

### 4. **Only Then Start Coding**

Now you can:

- Convert your plan to code.
- Make smaller adjustments instead of rewriting big chunks.

---

### 5. **Reflect After Each Task**

Ask yourself:

- What went well?
- What could I have done before starting to code?
- What repeated mistakes did I make?

### What You Can Do to Improve:

- **Learn Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Think more about classes, data flow, functions, and interaction before jumping into code.
- **Pair Programming or Code Reviews**: Watch how more experienced engineers plan things.
- **Write More Pseudo-code**: Force yourself to think without the editor.
