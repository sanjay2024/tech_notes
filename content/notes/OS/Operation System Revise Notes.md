## What is kernel in operation ?

In an operating system, the kernel is ==the core component that acts as the bridge between the computer's hardware and software, managing essential system resources like memory and CPU time==. It controls all fundamental operations, ensuring that processes have the necessary resources to run and that hardware devices like the keyboard and monitor can communicate with the rest of the system. The kernel is one of the first programs to load when a computer starts and remains in memory, handling crucial tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, and I/O (input/output) operations.

Key Functions of the Kernel

- **Process Management:**
    
    The kernel schedules which processes get to use the CPU and for how long, managing the overall execution of programs. 
    
- **Memory Management:**
    
    It monitors and manages how much memory is being used by different processes, ensuring that each application has enough. 
    
- **Device Management:**
    
    The kernel controls hardware devices, such as storage, keyboards, and network cards, allowing them to be used by applications. 
    
- **System Calls:**
    
    It provides a set of services, called system calls, that applications use to request resources or access hardware functions from the kernel. 
    
- **Interrupt Handling:**
    
    The kernel handles hardware and software interrupts (signals requiring immediate attention), ensuring that the system remains responsive.
