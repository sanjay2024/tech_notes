**Welcome to My World! 🌍**

Hi! I’m Sanjay, a full‑stack developer who loves solving hard problems and building resilient, delightful systems. I write about Web Development, DevOps, Generative AI, and more.

This site is my digital “second brain” — a living collection of notes, debugging journeys, design explorations, and distilled lessons from real projects and experiments.


### 🧠 **My Tech Notes**
